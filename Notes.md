## Data Structures

### Trees
* **Leaf Node:** Node with no children
* **Complete:** A tree that has all levels filled, except maybe the last level. Levels must be filled left to right.
* **Full:** A binary tree where all its nodes have zero or two children.
* **Perfect:** A binary tree that is full and complete. If `k` is the number of levels, a tree must have 2^k - 1 nodes to be perfect.
